# ChatGPT-extension

What is it?
A Google Chrome extension that uses the OpenAI API to analyze the content of the currently open page to meet the user's needs.

Why?
I created this extension because ChatGPT and artificial intelligence are becoming increasingly important in everyday life. It is becoming crucial to have access to this powerful technology to make our lives easier. I often found myself copying the content of a website and asking ChatGPT to summarize it or provide information about the web page.

How?
This project is based on JavaScript for the back-end, handling the business logic, and HTML/JavaScript for the front-end. It uses the OpenAI API to manage all automatic responses thanks to their innovative technology.

And for the future?
I will work on improving security and the display of responses to create an extension that can be used by the entire community.

# INFO-

Security Improvements: Enhancing the security measures to protect user data and API keys.
